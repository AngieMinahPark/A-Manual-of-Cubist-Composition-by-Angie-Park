## Modeling close reading in-class

* For this activity, we use [PRISM](http://prism.scholarslab.org/) to generate a collective close reading of a short passage in-class, highlighting the passage for instances of diction, tone, and imagery. Our collective close reading will be posted here once the activity is complete.
